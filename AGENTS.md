# Repository guide

This repository is a pnpm monorepo for an Effect + Foldkit application deployed to Cloudflare with Alchemy.

## Package boundaries

- `apps/web` is the Foldkit website and its website Worker.
- `apps/backend` is the API Worker and owns server-side behavior.
- `packages/rpc` contains only the typed wire contract shared by the browser and API Worker.
- `examples/reference` is a maintained, separately runnable example. It is not part of the default deployment.
- Keep Alchemy resources and deployment composition in the root `alchemy.run.ts`. App-owned `src/worker.ts` files are plain Cloudflare Worker entry modules and must not import Alchemy or declare infrastructure.
- Do not add a domain package or product domain until the product vocabulary and boundaries are agreed.

## Working agreements

- Keep the browser from importing `apps/backend` or platform-specific modules.
- Keep RPC schemas and errors in `packages/rpc`; keep handlers and internal models in `apps/backend`.
- Use Foldkit Query for retained remote data. Loading and revalidation decisions belong in Foldkit update handlers.
- Add a workspace package only for a real reusable or independently owned boundary.
- Keep Cloudflare services out of the starter unless a concrete feature needs them.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` runs the default Alchemy stack.
- `pnpm dev:reference` runs the reference stack.
- `pnpm check` runs Vite+ formatting, lint, and configured checks.
- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` run through Turbo.
- `pnpm deploy` changes Cloudflare infrastructure. Do not run it without explicit approval.

See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/tooling.md` before changing workspace boundaries or tool ownership.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
